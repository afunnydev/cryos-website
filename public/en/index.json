[{"content":" The wearing of foot orthotics is a prescribed treatment that remedies foot and postural problems. However, before obtaining an orthotic prescription, a certified health professional must be consulted to diagnose and determine the nature of the problem. Read further to discover the main steps you need to take to get a foot orthotic prescription from a Doctor of Podiatric Medicine (DPM), your foot and postural health specialist.\nWHAT ARE THE REASONS THAT LEAD TO A FIRST CONSULTATION FOR FOOT ORTHOTICS? Lower limb pain or a foot injury often lead to a first consultation with a DPM. It can be pain in the feet, knees, hips and even the lower back. It is also possible for people to meet with a DPM when they are looking to improve their general posture. Whatever the reason, the DPM will find the source of the problem and prescribe the proper treatment, which may include foot orthotics.\nWhy prescribe foot orthotics?\n Hallux-abducto-valgus (bunions) Plantar fasciitis / heel spurs Tendinopathy/Tendinitis Plantar neuroma To improve balance or stability Inadequate biomechanics   For postural problems, foot orthotics will improve bone, muscle, and joint alignment. In many cases, inadequate biomechanics are the cause of poor posture and pain.\n A FIRST MEETING WITH A FOOT SPECIALIST At the first meeting, the DPM will inquire about the history of the patient and the reasons that led them to seek consultation. Based on the answers obtained, the doctor will locate the pain in the feet and the underlying cause will be identified. The necessary examinations, including a biomechanical analysis, will then be conducted to determine the best treatment. After studying the results, the doctor will be able to determine whether the wearing of foot orthotics should be the recommended course of treatment for the patient.\nEXAMINATIONS REQUIRED FOR THE WEARING OF FOOT ORTHOTICS During the same initial meeting, the DPM conducts postural and biomechanical examinations. The objective is to evaluate muscular functioning as well as the amplitude of movements and joints. The doctor will then be able to fully understand the functioning of the patient’s feet, and if he finds it necessary, prescribe foot orthotics.\nHOW DO THEY DO THIS? The DPM begins by using two types of exams. The first objective is to evaluate the muscular and articular functioning of the lower limbs. During the examination, the patient is in a sitting position with their feet raised in the air. Following this, the doctor conducts a postural evaluation examination to target the source of the foot pain. For this assessment, the patient will stand on their feet.\nTo complete his examinations, the DPM can use CryoVizion medical imaging technology. This is an excellent measurement tool that provides complete information on posture, feet, knees, hips as well as the back. Furthermore, CryoVizion imaging provides a visual display to patients that helps them understand the reasons they need to wear a foot orthotic. The images taken are also a great baseline reference that helps evaluate the evolution of the treatment. Lastly, another important benefit is that the medical imaging technique is non-invasive and poses no threat to the health of the patient.\nWalking gait analysis: the doctor analyzes how the patient walks, and the functioning of the lower limbs, while in motion.\nTHE PRESCRIPTION OF FOOT ORTHOTICS If the wearing of foot orthotics is the recommended treatment, the doctor will take a mould of the foot in the position necessary to correct or better accommodate the foot. The mould will then be sent to the laboratory for the manufacture of the foot orthotic. Furthermore, they will take the time to explain the reasons for choosing to use foot orthotics as well as all the next steps.\nRECEIVING FOOT ORTHOTICS AND HOW TO WEAR THEM When the DPM receives the foot orthotics from the lab, they will schedule an appointment with the patient. During the appointment, the doctor will ensure that the product conforms to what is required, and that it is comfortable for the patient. Finally, they will make recommendations on the progressive wearing of the device, and how long the adaptation period will be. The patient will have all the information they require regarding the wearing and proper maintenance of the device.\nFOLLOW-UP MEETINGS FOR FOOT ORTHOTICS A first follow-up meeting will be scheduled in the first couple of weeks following the delivery of the device. The objective is to assess how the treatment of the problem is progressing and to evaluate the progress of the treatment to alleviate foot pain or to improve general posture. The doctor also makes certain that the foot orthotics are comfortable during this period of adaptation. If modifications are required, the doctor will make the appropriate adjustments. Following this, annual follow-ups are recommended for adults, while it is preferable for children to consult the doctor every 6 months.\n","href":"http://www.cryos.com/en/steps-to-wearing-foot-orthotics/","tags":["Foot orthotics"],"title":"The Steps To Wearing Foot Orthotics - Cryos Technologies"},{"content":"","href":"http://www.cryos.com/en/professionals/cryovizion/","tags":null,"title":"Cryos Technologies | CryoVizion for podiatrists"},{"content":"","href":"http://www.cryos.com/en/professionals/cryos-orthotics/","tags":null,"title":"Cryos Technologies | Cryos Dynamic Orthotics"},{"content":" The Achilles tendon is the largest and one of the strongest tendons in the human body. It is responsible for foot flexibility and a range of bodily motions. When there is pain in the ankle, it is best to consult a Doctor of Podiatric Medicine (DPM) who has the knowledge and training to treat Achilles tendinitis. Although Achilles tendinitis is difficult to treat, the foot specialist is well-prepared to help patients heal as quickly as possible. Following is more information on the condition and the possible treatments available for treating Achilles tendinitis.\nWHAT IS ACHILLES TENDINITIS? Achilles tendinopathy are divided into two main groups. The most common is tendinopathy of the middle portion of the Achilles tendon. It is more precisely a degenerative disease of the tendon and not due to inflammation. A grouping of small micro-tears that have not adequately healed are responsible for this condition.\nHOW TO CARE FOR ACHILLES TENDINITIS? Usually, conservative treatments that decrease heel pain are recommended. The most commonly prescribed are rest, stretching exercises, the wearing of foot orthotics, as well as the wearing of shoes that are better adapted to the feet.\nIS IT POSSIBLE TO ULTIMATELY CURE ACHILLES TENDINITIS? It is possible to completely heal from Achilles tendinitis. However, a great deal of patience is required and the foot specialist’s instructions must be strictly adhered to. Complete healing may require a period of 3 to 6 months, depending on the severity of the condition. On the other hand, improvement of the condition and pain relief is achieved fairly quickly.\nWHAT ARE THE PRE-EXISTING SIGNS OF ACHILLES TENDINITIS? Achilles tendinitis can be identified by pain in the back of the ankle that is often worse when the patient is walking. The condition causes stiffness when waking and pain that persists throughout the day. Sometimes, it’s also possible to see a round mass at the back of the tendon. This symptom comes from micro-tears that have not properly healed, causing inflammation in the tendon.\nTHE CAUSES OF ACHILLES TENDINITIS. Although there are many different causes, Achilles tendinitis is mainly caused by hypermobility in the ankle and in the back of the foot. When there is too much movement from one side of the heel to the other, the tendon eventually forms micro-tears. This process continues until the Achilles tendon is afflicted with tendinitis. Such injuries occur as a result of repetitive movements, excessive pronation, muscle weakness, prolonged jogging or running, or activity changes. Following are some situations that can cause this type of injury:\n Muscle stiffness: insufficient stretching following physical exertion Increased activity: at the start of a new sport or activity that is very demanding on the Achilles tendon A change in a sports surface or running shoes: training on a new surface, or changing the type of shoes a person wears (for example minimalist running shoes)  HOW TO TREAT ACHILLES TENDINITIS USING FOOT ORTHOTICS? The role of the foot orthotic is to balance the foot and guide it in the right direction. This will prevent the excessive movement of the ankle and hindfoot, and provide increased stability. A foot specialist is able to prescribe the wearing of a foot orthotic if he determines it to be appropriate for the patient. During the examination, the DPM will conduct a thorough analysis using the CryoVizion medical imaging system to evaluate postural symmetry. They will also verify and ensure that there are no unbalancing conditions that can harm the feet, such as one leg being longer than the other.\nWHY CONSULT A FOOT DOCTOR FOR ACHILLES TENDONITIS? A DPM is one of the most knowledgeable and best-trained professionals capable of treating medical conditions involving the lower limbs. As specialists in the treatment of Achilles tendinitis, they can advise you on the best course of action for your condition, including the proper selection of footwear, and stretching routines. They can also perform tapping techniques, provide strengthening exercises, and prescribe made-to-order foot orthotics.\n","href":"http://www.cryos.com/en/how-to-treat-achilles-tendinitis/","tags":["Injuries","Pain"],"title":"How to treat achilles tendinitis? - Cryos Technologies"},{"content":" Health professionals use imaging devices and systems for a variety of medical purposes. A validated and recommended approach used by some foot doctors is to use imaging systems to more accurately evaluate and measure postural and biomechanical problems. The visual nature of this technology allows patients to more easily understand the mechanics behind their condition and its impact on their posture.\nWHAT IS POSTURAL IMAGING? Postural imaging is a measurement tool that helps with the diagnostic process by providing objective data in real time. The technology allows the doctor to produce coloured topographies of the musculoskeletal system. The results help the DPM determine if the body’s alignment is optimal by observing postural changes on the surface of the skin.\nWHAT POSTURAL ANOMALIES CAN IMAGING IDENTIFY A DPM can perform a postural evaluation to target the following issues:\n Pelvic asymmetry Misalignment Pelvic tilt Leg length discrepancies (or one longer leg) Inward or outward inclined knees General postural asymmetry  WHAT PAINS CAN ARISE FROM INADEQUATE POSTURE? Pain can be caused by poor workplace ergonomics, trauma, injury, hereditary factors, or a new physical activity that changes a person’s posture. People with these problems often experience daily pain. By consulting a DPM and following a customized treatment plan that is designed to consider all other treatments being provided by other professional caregivers, patients can regain a significantly higher quality of life.\nWHAT INFORMATION DOES POSTURAL IMAGING REVEAL? Postural imaging provides validation of the physical examination in addition to providing further information that may not be visible to the naked eye. The technology also allows the DPM to clearly see the interaction between different parts of the body.\nWHAT IS CRYOVIZION? Developed by Cryos Technologies, the CryoVizion imaging system is a tool used by postural health professionals for postural analysis. The system is known for the accuracy, reliability, and quality of the information provided.\nIS THE CRYOVIZION IMAGING SYSTEM EFFECTIVE? The CryoVizion imaging system has been gathering clinical data for nearly 20 years. Further to this, the effectiveness of CryoVizion has been scientifically validated by researchers at l’Université de Montréal because of the quality of the information it provides during postural analysis.\nClick here for more information.\nHOW DOES CRYOVIZION WORK? The first step is to enter the observation booth where cameras capture the reflection of light projected over the entire body. The imaging system then renders the results with the help of highly detailed images. The DPM analyzes the images in the presence of the patient, in order to help the patient better understand their condition.\nWHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES OF IMAGING? Imaging is frequently used because of its accuracy and the fact that it provides highly objective results. Furthermore, since the process emits no radiation, and thanks to its reflection system, this postural evaluation technology is completely safe. Imaging also provides instantaneous results, speeding up the posture analysis process for the doctor. Since the patient sees the images, they more quickly and fully understand the changes in their posture. Imaging is tremendously beneficial for those who are interested in seeing the evolution of their treatment and benefit from observing their postural change in real time.\nWHY ANALYZE THE FEET DURING A POSTURAL EVALUATION? The feet are the base of the body. To achieve a thorough diagnosis, the examination of the feet must be included in postural evaluations. The feet are either causative or reactive, which means they are either the source of a postural problem, or have adapted to accommodate the problem. The information provided by the examination will help identify the postural problem, and the possible treatments available.\nWHY CONSULT A DPM IN THE CASE OF POSTURE-RELATED PAIN? The DPM establishes a treatment plan to alleviate the pain caused by a postural or biomechanical anomaly. When an illness persists, DPMs are often called upon to contribute to the treatment prescribed by other health professionals. Their expertise and treatment plan complements other efforts to help maximize results and healing. Conversely, if deemed necessary, the DPM will recommend that their patients consult a physiotherapist, an osteopath, a chiropractor, a massage therapist, or another professional. The primary objective is to treat the problems at the source, while at the same time improving the quality of life of patients.\n","href":"http://www.cryos.com/en/postural-evaluation-by-imaging/","tags":["Biomechanical","Sporting injuries","Foot orthotics","Posture"],"title":"Postural Evaluation By Imaging - Cryos Technologies"},{"content":" Custom-made orthotics are created by taking impressions of the feet. Precision is of the utmost importance in achieving the intended results of the treatment. While there are several impression taking techniques, some have been proven to be more effective and increase the quality of orthotic devices. Read on to get a foot specialists opinion on 2D and 3D impression taking techniques\nWHY DOES A DPM TAKE FOOTPRINTS? Following the diagnosis, the DPM will prescribe the treatment necessary to correct the problem. In order to make custom orthotics, the patient’s footprint, in the corrected position, has to be taken. The footprints will then be sent to the laboratory where specialists precisely manufacture the orthotics: the better the footprint taken, the more effective the treatment.\nWHAT IS A THREE-DIMENSIONAL FOOTPRINT? 3D impression taking involves a process where an image of the feet is captured by a three-dimensional scanner. The technology recreates the morphology of each foot with unparalleled precision, and the end result perfectly represents the feet with regards to volume, size, and spacing.\nWHAT IS A TWO-DIMENSIONAL FOOTPRINT? 2D footprints are captured using a podograph. The morphology of the feet is illustrated by a podography, which shows the foot surface and the position of each foot when it is flat on the ground.\nWHAT ARE THE TECHNIQUES FOR TAKING IMPRESSIONS? Taking foot impressions can be accomplished in a number of ways, depending on the DPM’s approach. The most commonly used techniques involve footprints taken under full weight, semi weight or non-weight bearing positions.\n Full weight impression: the patient is standing when the doctor takes the impression Semi weight impression: the patient remains seated while the doctor positions the foot and applies a load to the foot Non-weight impression: once the feet are positioned properly in the air, the doctor captures the impressions using plaster, foam, wax or a 3D scanner.\n  WHAT IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE METHOD? 3D foot impressions provide greater accuracy compared to 2D impressions. There is a greater degree of precision and information that facilitates the manufacture of the foot orthotics. In addition, the risk of human error resulting from manual processes is greatly reduced when using 3D technology. It’s important to know that a footprint that does not properly represent the morphology of the feet will greatly reduce the effectiveness of foot orthotics over both the short, and long term.\nWHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES OF TAKING 3D FOOTPRINTS? The 3D footprinting method is unique in the world, and it provides a huge benefit for both doctors and patients. Its accuracy makes it possible to produce high-performance dynamic orthotics to more effectively treat foot conditions.\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION TO BE CONSIDERED BEFORE THE PURCHASE OF FOOT ORTHOTICS. Custom-made foot orthotics are a highly tailored treatment that evolves over time. The best devices on the market stand out because of their flexion-extension movement, comfort, size, and versatility. Because these devices are designed to work in harmony with the foot without restricting movement, Cryos dynamic orthotic devices have been qualified as some of the most adaptive devices on the market. This advantage is made possible because of the use of 3D impression taking systems and a semi-weight impression taking technique that provides superior precision in capturing the morphology of the feet.\nYour choice of doctor is equally important, since their role in guiding patients towards the best solution to treat their condition is critical. Before choosing to use orthotics, you have to select the right medical professional to identify the issue, answer your questions, and meet your expectations. This will help you to better understand the benefits of orthotics, and the progression of your treatment in both the short and long term.\n","href":"http://www.cryos.com/en/2d-3d-analysis-foot-morphology/","tags":["Foot orthotics","Flat feet"],"title":"2D/3D Foot Morphology- Cryos Technologies"},{"content":" Forefoot surgery is a treatment used for conditions such as hallux abducto valgus (a deformity commonly called a bunion). When a patient is experiencing pain or limitations that are detrimental to his or her quality of life, surgery in the forefoot is a possible solution. In fact, surgical treatment may be combined with foot orthotics to attain increased beneficial effects that can be felt both before and after surgery.\nWHAT QUESTIONS SHOULD A PATIENT ASK BEFORE FOREFOOT SURGERY? Before considering surgery, the patient has to first understand the cause of the condition. It is recommended to consult a foot doctor, who will conduct a complete biomechanical examination in order to get to the source of the problem. The DPM will then be able to explain what biomechanical factors are responsible for the deformity in the forefoot. If possible, they will recommend orthotic treatments before invasive surgery. In all cases, the patient will be better prepared to understand and make an informed decision about all the proposed treatments to cure a forefoot problem.\nWHAT ARE THE MAIN CAUSES OF FOREFOOT DEFORMITIES. Most forefoot deformities are the result of instability with respect to how the feet are functioning. The patient may have a deformity of the feet originating from one or more factors including:\n the initial positioning of the feet the biomechanical alignment of their axes of motion an environment factor, such as their shoes and the type of surface on which they walk the frequency and number of consecutive hours they are on their feet  WHY ARE FOOT ORTHOTICS RECOMMENDED BEFORE AND AFTER SURGERY? Patients with bone deformities such as hallux abducto valgus (bunions) will have better results if their walking gait is normalized by wearing foot orthotics before surgery, as well as after. The treatment will control the causal factors, which will accelerate the healing of the surgical area (bunion). If movement is still not optimal, the wearing of foot orthotics will compensate for future demands placed on the forefoot. The patient\u0026rsquo;s walking gait will be more ideal preventing the recurrence of the same deformity.\nWHAT IS INVOLVED IN THE WEARING OF FOOT ORTHOTICS PRIOR TO FOREFOOT SURGERY? The majority of forefoot surgeries are caused by biomechanical problems such as bunions. Patients with biomechanical pathologies should wear functional orthotics between 3 and 6 months prior to surgery, as recommended by their foot doctor. The DPM can prescribe foot orthotics to correct, prevent, and compensate for biomechanical deformities.\nFollowing forefoot surgery, the DPM may modify the anterior foot orthotics or prescribe new ones in order to control the axes of movement of the feet. Because the foot structure will have changed following surgery, it is important that the patient’s feet and devices are re-evaluated by the DPM. Cryos medical imaging technology and orthotics are an excellent choice to help examine the feet and for the prescription of new orthotics.\nCAN THE WEARING OF ORTHOTICS DELAY OR PREVENT THE NEED FOR FOREFOOT SURGERY? If the wearing of orthotics is prescribed at a young age, it is possible to delay or prevent certain foot surgeries required to correct biomechanical deformities such as hallux valgus, hammer toe, and other conditions. In fact, many patients with biomechanical problems have to wear orthotics, even after forefoot surgery, while some can choose to wear orthotics without having to resort to surgery. It is recommended to consult a foot doctor to help you determine which solution best fits your situation and needs.\n","href":"http://www.cryos.com/en/the-benefits-of-foot-orthotics-before-and-after-surgery/","tags":["Foot orthotics","Flat feet"],"title":"Foot Orthotics and Surgery - Cryos
