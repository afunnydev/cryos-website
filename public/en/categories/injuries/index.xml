      <description>The Achilles tendon is the largest and one of the strongest tendons in the human body. It is responsible for foot flexibility and a range of bodily motions. When there is pain in the ankle, it is best to consult a Doctor of Podiatric Medicine (DPM) who has the knowledge and training to treat Achilles tendinitis.
